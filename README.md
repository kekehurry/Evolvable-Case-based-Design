# Evolvable-Case-based-Design
 
The dataset and pretrained checkpoints is available at:
+ https://pan.baidu.com/s/1adqooxSNpH4T7rpmq14nYA (code:esi4)

# 1 Description
This repository is the interface of the evolvable case-based design system: an AI support system for urban morphology generation. This system can automaticllay learn the morphological pattern in the datasets and allows users to untorl the floor space index(FSI) and ground space index(GSI) of the generated results.

# 2 Usage
+ download the repository.
+ download the pretrained checkpoints and put them inside "checkpoints\Shenzhen".
+ run the interface:

    streamlit run app.py
